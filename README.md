# Welcome to Amira's Portfolio

I built this webpage for my coding bootcamp. The assignment was to replicate a sample portfolio page. Our instructor told us to try to make our portfolio page look as close as possible to the sample page. I tried to mimick the color scheme and stylings.

I spent many hours on this page, and could spend many more to get it closer to the sample page. I've learned a lot.

I think I did a pretty good job on the top part of the page. See first screenshot.

When hovering over the images in the "Work" section, the opacity changes. You can see the opacity change in the 2nd screenshot attached - where the cursor is hovering on the coffee image.

I did not spend enough time on making the page responsive but want to keep learning about that.<img width="1440" alt="Portfolio-screenshot-1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80497167/115975928-8ac24c00-a52e-11eb-9176-c6851e562edd.png">
